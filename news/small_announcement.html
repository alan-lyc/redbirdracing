			<section>
				<p>We have been pushing very hard to develop our racecar to participate in the Formula Student UK events. Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have not been able to travel and compete. That did not stop us from joining the online Concept Class. In FSUK 2021, we achieved encouraging results and we aimed to strike higher in FSUK 2022.</p>
				<p>However, we were deeply saddened to acknowledge that FSUK 2022 Concept Class will only be offered in a face-to-face mannner. Due to the travel restrictions and the high cost of the return quarantine, it is impossible for us to travel to the UK.</p>
				<p><b>We would like to announce that we are not joining FSUK 2022.</b></p>
				<p>We will keep hustlinng to bring our next generation FS racecar- <b>RBR-4</b>. We will continue testing and optimizing while nurturing the next generation of engineering talents. We are actively seeking chances to prove ourselves, and we are also looking into possibility of local competition in Hong Kong.</p>
